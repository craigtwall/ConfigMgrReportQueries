# ConfigMgr Report Queries
Copies of SQL Queries Used to Gather Info For SCCM / MEMCM / Configuration Manager Reports. Mostly SQL-Based, but I plan to have WQL alternatives for each

## What Can You Expect To Find Here?

Mostly, SQL queries that I've blogged on the use of. 

Built-in Configuration Manager/SCCM reports only go so far.

## Will I Add Anything Else?

I intend to show alternatives for each of the queries using PowerShell and WQL. 

I also intend to create reports, probably nothing too fancy, and share those out, too. 

## Who Am I?

I'm Craig Wall, a New Jersey public sector systems administrator specializing in deployment and endpoint management.

I've worked for a county agency, a state agency, and now manage endpoints at Rutgers University.
